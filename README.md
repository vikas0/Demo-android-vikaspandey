# Demo-android-vikaspandey
2 screen application written with android architecture pattern

first one with showing list of deliverable items where the source of data is network backed local database, 
and the second is detail screen with a map view showing the location of the deliverable item.


Concepts used:
1) mvvm design pattern
2) dagger 2 for dependency Injection
3) Language is kotline
4) paging, databinding librries feom android jetpack 
5) Room database and live data for reactiveness
6) coroutines for asyn tasks
7) androidx test library for android test and junit 4 for unit test, mockito for mocking dependencies in test classes

Scope of enhancements:
1) More auromated test can be written, feel like writing test after writing the main code does not enable us to write full and effective test
 Lession learnt :
  first write necessary interfaces and abstract classes, and then write test classes then write the implementation so as to pass all the test.
